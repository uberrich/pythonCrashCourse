# Python Crash Course exercise work

This is a simple repo to store code and other output from working through the [Python Crash Course (2nd Ed.)](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e) book. Each chapter gets its own directoy, and each exercise within that chapter gets a sub-directory.

If anyone reads this, feel free to comment on my work by raising issues. It would be great to get into discussions and for me to learn from others, and, just possibly, others to learn from me! ðŸ˜‰.

More information about the book can be found on it GitHub Pages site: <https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_2e/> or at the author's repo on GitHub: <https://github.com/ehmatthes/pcc_2e>

Speaking of the author, many thanks to Eric Matthes for writing the book. You can find more information about him on his [Github profile](https://github.com/ehmatthes).
