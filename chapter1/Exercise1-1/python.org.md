# Exploring the [Python Home Page](https://python.org)

A nice looking website. The 'System Administration' line in the 'Use Python for...' section immediately jumps out at me, in particular the fact that it mentions Ansible.

I'm sure the [beginner's guide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide) will be useful! As might the [tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)! And maybe the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) in general.
