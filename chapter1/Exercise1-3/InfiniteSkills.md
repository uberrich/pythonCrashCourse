# What to build with infinite programming skills?

A non-evil Facebook?!

Some more modest ideas:

- A way to analyse my home electricity usage to figure out if it's worth getting solar panels?
  - Would I use their power output during the day when it's light?
  - Or are they only worthwhile with battery storage?
  - Depends on my energy usage patterns. Can I use Python to visualise this somehow?
  - And can I understand how long it will take to pay off the investment? And can I vary the cost of electricty to see how this period will change if the cost goes up?
