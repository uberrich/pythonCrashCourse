# Introduce a typo that doesn't make an error

Missing the 'o' from 'world' does not result in an error:

`PS C:\Users\rlewis\GitRepos\github.com\pythonCrashCourse\chapter1\Exercise1-2> python .\hello_world_typo_no_error.py
Hello Python wrld!`

It just outputs the incorrect statement. It clearly doesn't care what's between the quotation marks; it will output whatever you tell it to.
